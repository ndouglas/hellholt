An API for retrieving data and other resources about things in _A Song of Ice and Fire_.

This is mostly just a fun way for me to automate custom resources for [my homelab](https://github.com/ndouglas/bitterbridge) via [an intermediary app](https://github.com/ndouglas/feastfires).  If you're looking for information about the books themselves, you might try [An API of Ice and Fire](https://anapioficeandfire.com/).

Most (or all) of the images and other resources in this repository are not my creation and were nabbed from [_A Wiki of Ice and Fire_](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/).

I'm working on crediting the original artists and content creators as I build this.  If you see something on here that isn't appropriately credited, please open an issue and I'll take care of it.  It's purely accidental and probably the result of me committing something before I intended.
